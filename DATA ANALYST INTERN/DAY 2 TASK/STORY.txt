Life Style of a Community – A Data Visualization Story Using Power BI
In a quiet neighborhood tucked between city bustle and rural calm, a community lives not just by numbers—but by rhythm. Their income isn’t just a figure—it’s a reflection of effort, dreams, and shared responsibilities. Their education isn’t just a qualification—it’s a legacy passed from one generation to the next.
This dashboard doesn’t just analyze—it listens.
It hears the laughter of children in homes where parents juggle work and hope. It sees the hands raised in community campaigns, not just for participation—but for belonging. It watches families count coins at the dinner table, not just to budget—but to build.
Through segmented visuals and engineered columns, we uncover:
• How marital status shapes lifestyle choices and campaign engagement.
• How income groups reflect not just wealth, but behavioral patterns.
• How education levels influence response, aspiration, and community voice.
Each chart is a window.
Each data point is a heartbeat.
Each image is a memory.
This is not a dashboard.
This is a portrait of people—living, learning, earning, and evolving together.
